What is GCW Toolkit? 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GCW Toolkit was made to analyse surface water in urban areas in Indonesia. There are now 4 steps to this process. 

1. Delineate the water areas

Whitin the water areas 3 variables are measured: 

1. Determine the changes in green space in a 50m buffer zone surrounding the water.
2. Sedimentation load in the water relative to other water areas in the city.
3. Overlap between the water area with the local cadastral map (if available).
